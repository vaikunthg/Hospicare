Area of Research and Development – Medical Service Assistant 

Describe the Problem - Health Care sector has major importance in our everyday life. Many times, during time of medical emergency people tend to panic and don’t make right decisions resulting in the loss of life. Reaching hospitals and explaining the situation to them result in major time loss and most of the time the life gets compromised. To overcome the above problem, we have come with a website “Hospicare”. The time loss and lack of knowledge during these times was the main focus of our project. Everyone can access this site during any kind of emergency.

Website Development – The design for our website has been done using HTML and CSS. Some JavaScript has also been used to make it more dynamic. Python has been used  to develop the back-end and also to add functions like OTP verification through email and SMS. Google Maps API has also been integrated to develop a GPS guidance system.
How will the Website work? - When user access the website, He/she will need to log-in/sign-up. And it will show nearby available hospitals on the Map with users’ location. User can apply for the desired services at the hospital by describing the condition of patient. User can also request/apply for a blood donation to various blood banks in the area. 
In case of any emergency – When user access the website, He/she will be able to see emergency tab on the top right corner. By accessing that tab, user will reach web page with “call us” button which will directly call our personnel. The personnel will be well versed with the knowledge of First -Aid and will be able to guide through the situation by informing the actions needed to be taken to maximize the chance of survival. He/she will also inform the nearby hospital of choice and keep their staff. Through our website a notification will be sent to the hospital. Reducing the time loss at to its minimum possible value. After the patient been admitted to the hospital the user will be needed to log-in to and get status updates on the condition of the patient.
